-- Unless required by applicdifications use the `socket.gettime()` function from LuaSocket
-- if available and hence reduce that problem (provided LuaSocket has been loaded before uuid).
--
-- **Important:** the random seed is a global piece of data. Hence setting it is
-- an application level responsibility, libraries should never set it!
--
-- See this issue; [https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/478](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/478)
-- It demonstrates the problem of using time as a random seed. Specifically when used from multiple processes.
-- So make sure to seed only once, application wide. And to not have multiple processes do that
-- simultaneously.
